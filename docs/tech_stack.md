# Tech Stack for Week 1 Prototype

We chose **Dialogflow** as the NLU/runtime for this prototype because it is hosted, easy to set up, and provides built-in support for multilingual prompts, including English and Hindi. Its main advantages are quick intent recognition, a user-friendly interface, and fast testing of mock booking, status, and cancellation flows. The main limitation is less control over complex rule-based logic compared to Rasa or custom LLMs, but it perfectly fits the Week 1 scope where we focus on handling sample utterances and generating mock outputs efficiently.
